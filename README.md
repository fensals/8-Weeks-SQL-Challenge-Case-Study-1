# 8-Weeks-SQL-Challenge-Case-Study-1

Danny is owns a little Japanese restaurant that sells Sushi, Ramen and Curry.

He  wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

Danny has provided  a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough  to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared  3 key datasets for this case study: sales, menu, members.

OBJECTIVE

To answer questions and generate insights to help Danny decide whether or not he should expand the existing customer loyalty program.
